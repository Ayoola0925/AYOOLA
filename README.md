## üëã About Me
I am Ajiboye Ayoola, a beginner data analyst with a background in business administration and management. While I‚Äôm new to the field of data analysis, I‚Äôve been actively working on various projects to build and enhance my skills. With 5 years of experience in inventory management, procurement, and business operations, I have developed strong analytical and problem-solving abilities, which I now apply to data-focused projects.

I am passionate about learning new tools and techniques to uncover insights from data and create meaningful visualizations. Through hands-on projects, I‚Äôve gained experience using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, and I continue to grow by exploring Python for data analysis. My goal is to transition into data analytics roles where I can apply my skills to solve real-world problems and help organizations make data-driven decisions.
